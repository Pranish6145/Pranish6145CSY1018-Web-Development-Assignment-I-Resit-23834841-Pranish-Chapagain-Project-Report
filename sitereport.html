    <h1 class="Shaun">My Experience in Web Development</h1>
    <h6>            9th July 2023 </h6><br>
    <p>I have a mixed bag of experience while learning the Web Development coming from the biology background it was
      quite tough getting settled here. I learnt different things with time learning to create navigation bar and other
      things it was quite fun as well. Chirag sir taught well and made basics clear so it was quite easy for me learn
      things quickly. As we say practice makes man perfect likewise after practicing it many times it became quite easy
      than initially it used to be. While learning HTML and CSS and doing this assignment made me learn a lot of things
      too like how to use correct tags and many CSS properties, I was not aware of it was quite frustrating as well when
      making changes to one thing made the things more complicated and had ruined other things but when you get good
      results or when the website looks quite attractive you forgot these all things. I felt difficulties initially as
      well while accessing the git too but after some time I realized the use of the git for coding. So, I came to know
      that if you do practice or hard work and dedication this thing has a lot more to offer. It was fun to do coding
      for the first time. It has helped in developing my personal skills which will be fruitful for my future. During
      this journey as a beginner gave me the lot of learning opportunities and helped to enhance by skills regarding the
      web development.

    <h1>Reason behind choosing this UI</h1>
    <p>The reason behind choosing this UI was just simple as It was the color and image which makes the mind peaceful
      and donâ€™t make people get irritated and I wanted to make this website look as simple as possible. And I personally
      loved that picture as well as the UI which was quite simple and for me looked quite awesome.</p>
